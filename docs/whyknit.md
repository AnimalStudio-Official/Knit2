# Why Knit?

## Structure (If you want)

Knit gives developers the ability to create services and controllers, which gives a game structure. However, not all the code has to live in either of these two systems. Code can live alone and still consume services and controllers.

Developers are free to organize codebases in any way.

## Framework / Library Hybrid
While advertised as a game framework, Knit straddles the line between a framework and a library. While Knit provides optional structure using services and controllers, developers can choose if and how these structures are utilized. Developers are also responsible for creating the runtime scripts for Knit (i.e. bootstrapping), which allows easy extensibility of the framework.
